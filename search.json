    "text": "As Nicola Aravecchia shows, the fieldwork at and publication of the site of ʿAin el-Gedida have brought to light a type of settlement that existed in large numbers in late antique Egypt, the rural hamlet dependent on and supporting a larger settlement. The ʿAin el-Gedida project took place as a subsidiary operation of the excavations at Amheida, at the time of the excavations sponsored by Columbia University, where I was then a faculty member. The work was supported by a Distinguished Achievement Award made to me by the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, and I take this opportunity to renew my thanks to the Foundation for this support. I am also grateful to the entire Amheida team for their moral and logistical support, particularly to my assistant Ashraf Barakat and to our house manager Gaber Murad. They solved problems at every stage and made this work possible.\n\n\nThe results of this excavation are being published as part of the Amheida series, even though they concern another site, both because the work was part of the Amheida project and, more importantly, because Amheida, Roman Trimithis, was made possible by a network of such rural settlements in its surroundings. Not only do the finds from ʿAin el-Gedida have many points of intersection with those at Amheida, but they help show how an urban settlement of the Roman period like Trimithis functioned in the oasis ecological and economic zone.",

    "text": "1.1 ʿAin el-Gedida and the Dakhla Oasis\nThe Dakhla Oasis lies in the Western Desert of Upper Egypt, ca. 800 km southwest of Cairo, 280 km southwest of Asyut, and about 300 km west of Luxor (Plate 1.1, Plate 1.2) It is one of the five major oases that lie west of the Nile Valley, including Siwa, Bahariya, Farafra, Dakhla, and Kharga.\nDakhla is oriented northwest–southeast and has an extension of ca. 80 km from east to west and ca. 30 km from north to south, covering a green area of ca. 410 km². It lies to the south of an escarpment, 300 to 400 m high, which separates the depression of the oasis from the northern Libyan plateau.1 In fact, the oasis does not consist of a continuum of fertile, irrigated land, but rather of a set of smaller oases, divided by the desert. To the west of Dakhla are the dunes of the Great Sand Sea, and to the south is a vast desert expanse leading to Sudan. About 190 km east of Dakhla, and separated from it by desert land, is the Kharga Oasis. Apart from the escarpment, the only mountain of the depression is Gebel Edmondstone, located toward the northwest end of the oasis. Smaller outcrops and spring mounds dot the relatively flat landscape, which is at a height of 92–140 m above sea level.2\nThe natural environment of Dakhla is harsh. The average temperatures are high, soaring to 40° and beyond during the summer months.3 Also, significant temperature differences exist between day and night, especially in the winter. Precipitation is a very rare occurrence, while northern winds hit the oasis with fierce intensity, causing sandstorms that halt any human activity.4\nThe oasis lies in a region that is the result of geological phenomena occurring since the Early Cretaceous.5 Surveys carried out in Dakhla gathered evidence, datable from the Late Cretaceous to the Quaternary Eras, proving that large parts of the oasis were covered with water.6 Afterwards, dramatic environmental changes led to a progressive desertification process of the entire region, which obliterated the rich prehistoric fauna and flora and the first human settlements of the oasis, while wind erosion progressively cancelled their traces.\nIn antiquity, several roads and caravan routes connected Dakhla with the neighboring oases, the Nile Valley, and farther regions, mostly through the northern escarpment or via Kharga (Plate 1.3).7 The northern escarpment is dotted with passes, which allow access from the oasis onto the plateau and further north.8 The Darb el-Tawil is a desert track linking Dakhla to Manfalut, near Asyut in the Nile Valley, and was one of the two main routes used in antiquity to the oasis. Another route, only partially known, heading to Asyut is the Darb el-Khashabi; it sets off at the village of Ismant and heads straight north onto the escarpment via the Naqb Ismant. The main alternative route to the Nile Valley is via Kharga, which is connected to Dakhla through the Darb ʿAin Amour, a road crossing the Abu Tartur Plateau. A longer, but easier, path from Dakhla to Kharga is the Darb el-Ghubari, which runs further south and bypasses the Abu Tartar Plateau. The Darb el-Farafra leaves from El-Qasr in the western part of the oasis and after crossing the escarpment at Bab el-Qasmund runs northwest to the Farafra Oasis, continuing thereafter to Bahariya and further north. The Darb Abu Minqar is the modern roadway, leaving from El-Qasr and passing by the Gebel Edmondstone in a northwest direction (toward Farafra and beyond). The only route heading south of Dakhla is the Darb al-Tarfawi, crossing the inhospitable southwestern desert.\nLife in Dakhla has been made possible since antiquity by easy access to water, located in aquifers under the sandstone bed of the oasis.9 The low elevation of the depression makes it relatively easy to reach subterranean water, which is rich in sulfur and iron. Hundreds of wells are spread throughout the oasis, many of which date to the Roman period, and several springs can also be found.10 An extensive network of irrigation canals brings the water from the wells, which nowadays are often operated with mechanical pumps, to the cultivated fields.11 A few traces of what may have been ancient qanats12 (irrigation systems based on a series of vertical shafts connected through a sloping underground channel and transporting water from its source to destination), have been detected, although not yet excavated, in the oasis.13 This paucity of archaeological evidence seems to contrast with the abundance of remains found in the neighboring Kharga Oasis, raising questions about the possible reasons.14\nEvidence of human activity in Dakhla can be traced back to ca. 400,000 BCE, in the Lower Palaeolithic.15 The Neolithic is also represented, with remains that are datable to the first half of the ninth millennium BCE.16 The oasis lies far from the Nile Valley but, notwithstanding its location that favored a relatively high degree of isolation, it held regular contacts with the people of the Valley throughout its history. In the Pharaonic period, Dakhla (together with its neighboring oases) was a strategic outpost on the way to Nubia and an economically significant site.17 According to A. J. Mills, the oasis experienced the arrival of a substantial number of migrants/settlers from the Valley starting around 2300 BCE, likely employed in the agricultural exploitation of the fertile land.18 Archaeological evidence of settlements from the Old to the New Kingdom and into the Persian Period was found, although the number of Old Kingdom sites vastly outnumbers those from the Middle and New Kingdom.19 The oasis was continuously inhabited under the Ptolemies (although the evidence for this period is only now becoming substantial as a result of excavations at Mut)20 and, after 30 BCE, under the Romans, when intensive agricultural development took place.21 At an administrative level, Dakhla became part of the “Great Oasis”, which included Kharga, and was then divided into the Mothite and Trimithite nomes in later Roman times.22 It was under the administration of Rome that the oasis reached its highest population density until modern times and its economy thrived.23 Water and fertile land were not the only reasons that attracted the interest of the Romans in the Great Oasis. Indeed, the region was strategically located at the periphery of the empire and along major caravan routes. These factors were likely the rationale for the establishment, throughout the region and especially in Kharga, of military outposts and fortresses, with the aim to protect the roads and the empire’s commercial interests.24\nDakhla was populated also in the Byzantine period, although with evidence for economic decline and the abandonment, between the end of the fourth and the fifth century, of some areas of the oasis,25 and from the Arab conquest until modern times.\nIts “re-discovery” began in the early nineteenth century, with the exploration of several European travelers who wrote about the oasis, its people, and its significant archaeological remains.26 The first European traveler to leave a written record of his trip to Dakhla was Sir Archibald Edmondstone, in whose honor the gebel at the west end of Dakhla was later named.27 His arrival in the oasis in 1819 was immediately followed by that of Bernardino Drovetti, a French diplomat of Italian origin, and then by several other Europeans, including Frédéric Cailliaud (1819), Frederic Muller (1824), and John G. Wilkinson (1824). In 1874, Dakhla was reached by the scientific expedition organized by the German Gerhard Rohlfs, who carefully recorded the topography of the oasis.28 In 1894, Captain H. G. Lyons went to Dakhla, followed in 1898 by Hugh Beadnell, who surveyed the oasis for the Geological Survey of Egypt, which had been founded in 1896.29 In 1908, H. E. Winlock and Arthur M. Jones traveled to Dakhla, and Winlock published a detailed account of his trip in 1936.30 Still today, his diary is a source of significant information on the oasis before the modernization process of the mid-twentieth century. W. J. Harding King followed in 1909, on a mission for the Royal Geographical Society.31\nThe relative geographical isolation experienced by Dakhla, the natural environment, and the dry climate have favored, in contrast to what often happens in the Nile Valley, the excellent preservation of archaeological sites and artifacts. Nonetheless, it was only from the middle of the twentieth century, with the work of Ahmed Fakhry, that the oasis attracted significant scholarly attention.32 In 1977, the Institut Français d’Archéologie Orientale (IFAO) began its scientific activity in Dakhla. In 1978, an international, multidisciplinary research venture—the Dakhleh Oasis Project (D.O.P.) —was created, with the aim to investigate all aspects of the oasis environment, its changes, and their effect on the development of human presence and activity in the oasis.33 Research under the D.O.P. umbrella spans the period from Prehistory to the modern era; it is independently carried out by different teams and institutions, but always in a collaborative fashion, which promotes the exchange of knowledge and data among the various disciplines.34",

    "text": "1.2 Early Christianity in Dakhla35\n\nBecause ʿAin el-Gedida will appear in what follows to have been part of a fourth-century Christian environment,36 some preliminary remarks on the evidence for early Christianity in the oasis may be helpful. It is during the fourth century that Christianity seems to have spread and developed dramatically in the region of the Western Desert, the evidence for earlier centuries being negligible.37 The particularly rich heritage of Early Christian monuments from the Kharga oasis, to the east of Dakhla, points to the flourishing of Christian communities in the region long before the Arab conquest.38 Churches, monasteries, and cemeteries excavated or surveyed at Kharga are witnesses of the profound influence Christian art and architecture had on the natural and urban environment of that oasis.39\n\n\nAlthough the archaeological evidence for Christian monuments is more abundant, and is relatively better known, with regard to Kharga, the Dakhla Oasis also proved to be a suitable location for thriving Christian communities already at an early stage. In 1908, H. Winlock commented on the scarcity of Christian antiquities throughout the oasis, especially in comparison (as mentioned above) with the abundant and visible evidence from the nearby Kharga Oasis. As a possible cause, he blamed the relative distance of Dakhla from the Nile Valley and its Roman garrisons, which exposed the oasis to the dangers of invasion and destruction by neighboring nomadic tribes, which might have caused the abandonment of most settlements during the late Roman period.40\n\n\nThe Dakhleh Oasis Project survey, carried out from 1977 to 1987, recorded well over one hundred archaeological sites with phases of occupation assigned (on the basis of ceramic evidence) to the Byzantine Period (ca. 300–700 CE).41 For most of the sites listed as “Byzantine”,42 however, no remains were found pointing to their use by a specifically “Christian” community. The information that was collected allowed a preliminary dating of these sites, including large settlements but also smaller loci such as caves and cemeteries, to Late Antiquity.43 Substantial data gathered during the excavation of cemeteries at Kellis and, quite recently, at Deir Abu Matta and near Muzawwaka, provide evidence on Christian burial customs in Dakhla, which are consistent with those found at other Christian sites in Egypt: bodies lying supine with their head to the west and almost no goods associated with them.44 Yet, for most sites listed by the D.O.P., no precise conclusions can be drawn on the religious affiliation of the people living at those settlements. Literary, documentary, and archaeological evidence has shown that Egypt\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlate 1.4: Plan of the West Church complex at Kellis (after Bowen 2002a: 76, Fig. 8).\n\n\n\n\nbecame a profoundly Christianized country already in the fourth century.45 This might lead one to assume that Christian communities (including Manichaeans, whose existence is attested to in the oasis46) were somehow linked to most or all of the “Byzantine” sites identified in Dakhla, and indeed that is very likely by the later fourth century; however, any generalization is prevented by the fact that people from different ethnic, cultural, and religious backgrounds co-existed in Egypt in Late Antiquity. At least some Egyptian temples were still operating in the third century and perhaps even the first quarter of the fourth.47 Only an in-depth archaeological investigation could shed light on such matters in relation to those sites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlate 1.5: Plan of the East Churches complex at Kellis (after Bowen 2002a: 66, Fig. 2).\n\n\n\nREMAINDER OF CHAPTER NOT INCLUDED IN THIS QUARTO DEMO",

    "text": "Kleindienst et al. (1999, 1).↩︎\nDetailed information on the geology and geomorphology, but also on the palaeobotany and palaeozoology of the Dakhla Oasis, is available in Kleindienst et al. (1999). See also Mills (1999, 171).↩︎\nKleindienst et al. (1999, 3); see also Giddy (1987, 3).↩︎\nEspecially in the months from March to June: see Kleindienst et al. (1999, 3).↩︎\nKleindienst et al. (1999, 2).↩︎\nKleindienst et al. (1999, 6).↩︎\nVivian (2008, 180–81). See also Giddy (1987, 10–11).↩︎\nFrom west to east: Bab el-Qasmund, Naqb Asmant, Naqb Balat, Naqb Tineida, Naqb Rumi, Naqb Shyshini: see Vivian (2008, 180).↩︎\nThe particular type of sandstone found in Dakhla is described in detail in Schild and Wendorf (1977, 10). On the underground water and its possible sources, see Giddy (1987, 29–31).↩︎\nWells are considered a source of considerable wealth in the oasis: see Mills (1999, 177). On phreatic layers beneath the Western Desert, see Ball (1927a), Ball (1927b), Hellström (1940), Murray (1952).↩︎\nOn the irrigation systems used in Dakhla in antiquity and modern times, see Mills (1999, 173).↩︎\nArabic plural: qanawat.↩︎\n\nThese investigations were carried out under the auspices of the Egyptian Ministry of State for Antiquities.\n\n↩︎\nPossibly linked to the different geomorphology of the two oases and Dakhla’s more abundant water resources: cf. Bagnall and Worp (2004, 262). On qanats in Kharga, see, among others, Grimal (1995, 572–74) and Wuttmann (2001).↩︎\nThanks to the work of R. Schild and F. Wendorf (see their (1977) volume).↩︎\nMcDonald (1999, 130).↩︎\nGiddy (1987, 51–52).↩︎\nMills (1999, 174).↩︎\nBagnall and Worp (2004, 262).↩︎\nSee Gill (2012).↩︎\nDates, olives, and wine were among the specialized products of Dakhla and the other oases of the Western Desert in Roman times: see Kaper (1998, 2). According to Giddy (1987, 5), it is possible that the Romans were also interested in the extraction of alum.↩︎\nCf. P Kellis IV 73.↩︎\nAs testified to by the available archaeological and documentary evidence: see Bagnall and Worp (2004) [pp. 249; 262].↩︎\nBoozer (2007, 65–66). On military outposts in Kharga, see, among others, Reddé (1999) and Rossi (2012). On the remains of the Roman castrum in El-Qasr (Dakhla), see Kucera (2012).↩︎\nBagnall et al. (2015, 7). See Hope (2001) on the occupational history of Kellis. There is no consensus among scholars on the reasons for the decline in the local population and the abandonment of sites in Dakhla (and neighboring oases) during the fifth century. Diminished access to water may have likely caused (or contributed to) the abandonment of parts of sites in the region: cf. Kaper (2012, 718).↩︎\nSee Starkey and Starkey (2001) and Kleindienst et al. (1999, 7–8).↩︎\nSee Edmondstone (1822).↩︎\nSee Rohlfs (1875).↩︎\nSee Beadnell (1901); Vivian (2008, 429) (and more extensively in the 2000 edition of the same volume: 39–42).↩︎\nSee Winlock (1936).↩︎\nSee Harding King (1912).↩︎\nSee Fakhry (1982) and Mills (1985).↩︎\nThurston 2003: 17–22.↩︎\nSee the D.O.P website: http://dakhlehoasisproject.com.↩︎\nThe discussion, included in this section, on the churches of Kellis, Deir Abu Matta, Deir el-Molouk, ʿAin es-Sabil, and Amheida/Trimithis appeared in an earlier version in Bagnall et al. (2015): see Aravecchia (2015a), Aravecchia (2015b).↩︎\nSuch a connection will be established in the following sections, particularly Chapter 3, Chapter 5, and Chapter 7.↩︎\nOn the beginnings of Christianity in Egypt, see, among others, Bowman (1996, 190–202), Wipszycka (1996), and Davis (2004). On Early Christianity and ecclesiastical institutions in Egypt, see Wipszycka (1997); Wipszycka (2007).↩︎\nFor an introduction to Kharga, see Vivian (2008, 117–72) and Bagnall and Worp (2004, 249–61).↩︎\nAmong the most significant monuments of the Christian era in Kharga (and with the most dramatic visual impact on the natural landscape) are the cemetery of Bagawat (Fakhry 1951; Cipriano 2008) and Deir Mustafa Kashef (Müller-Wiener 1963).↩︎\nWinlock (1936, 60–61).↩︎\n119 “Byzantine” sites are listed in Churcher and Mills (1999, 263–64).↩︎\nAlthough not necessarily occupied only in that period.↩︎\n“Late Antique” is intended here as broadly overlapping, in chronological terms, with “Byzantine” (as used in the D.O.P. survey).↩︎\nBowen (2003, 168–71); see also Bowen (2008), Bowen (2009).↩︎\nWhile the evidence for earlier times is somewhat scantier: see Bagnall (1993, 278–80).↩︎\nCf. Gardner (1997b), Gardner (1997a), Gardner (2000).↩︎\nBagnall (1993, 261–68).↩︎",
